                    Vaping has been promoted as a potentially less harmful alternative to smoking cigarettes, as it
                    involves
                    inhaling vapor rather than smoke. However, there is still much research that needs to be done on the
                    long-term health effects of vaping, and it is not without its own risks.

                    Some people have used vaping as a tool to help them quit smoking cigarettes. The
                    nicotine in e-cigarettes can provide the same type of hit that smokers crave, but without the tar
                    and
                    other harmful chemicals found in cigarettes.

                    •It's important to note that these benefits are not yet scientifically proven and more research is
                    needed
                    to understand the long-term effects of vaping. Additionally, the recent cases of severe lung injury
                    associated with vaping have raised concern about the safety of vaping.

                    While vaping is generally considered to be less harmful than smoking cigarettes, it is not without
                    its
                    own risks.

                    some e-liquids have been found to contain potentially harmful substances, such as diacetyl (a chemical
                    linked to a serious lung disease called bronchiolitis obliterans) and heavy metals.

                reported.

            <h2>Side Effects Of Smoking</h2>

            <p>
                <br>
                Smoking cigarettes has numerous negative side effects on both your physical and mental health.

                Physical Side Effects:
                <br>

                •Increased risk of lung cancer: Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer, which is a type of cancer
                that starts in the lungs. It is also the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide.
                <br>

                •Heart disease: Smoking increases your risk of heart disease, which is a condition that causes your
                heart
                to work harder to pump blood throughout your body. This can lead to heart attacks, angina (chest pain),
                and strokes.
                <br>

                •Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): Smoking can cause COPD, which is a group of lung diseases
                that make it difficult to breathe. These diseases include chronic bronchitis and emphysema.
                <br>

                •Respiratory infections: Smoking damages the lining of your airways, making it easier for bacteria and
                viruses to enter your body and cause respiratory infections such as bronchitis and pneumonia.
                <br>

                •Reduced fertility: Smoking can affect both men and women's fertility. In men, it can reduce the number
                and quality of sperm, and in women, it can disrupt the menstrual cycle and make it harder to get
                pregnant.
                <br>

                •Mental Health Side Effects:
                <br>

                •Depression: Studies have shown that people who smoke are more likely to suffer from depression than
                those who do not smoke.
                <br>

                •Anxiety: Smoking can also increase feelings of anxiety and stress.
                <br>

                •Cognitive decline: Smoking can lead to cognitive decline, which is a decrease in mental abilities such
                as memory and concentration.
                <br>

                Overall, the negative side effects of smoking are numerous and severe. If you are a smoker, it is
                important to consider quitting in order to improve your overall health and well-being. There are many
                resources available to help you quit smoking, including nicotine replacement therapy, prescription
                medications, and support groups.

            <h2>Side Effects Of Vaping</h2>
            <hr>
            <div class="change2"><img src="Images/Side2.webp"></div>
            <p>
                <br>
                Inhale vaporized nicotine or non-nicotine solutions.
                While e-cigarettes are often marketed as a safer
                alternative to traditional cigarettes, they can still have negative side effects.
                <br>

                One of the main side effects of e-cigarette use is nicotine addiction.
                <br>
                E-cigarettes typically contain
                nicotine, which is a highly addictive substance that can lead to physical dependence. This can make it
                difficult for people to quit using e-cigarettes, even if they want to.
                <br>

                Another side effect of e-cigarette use is the potential for respiratory problems. The vapor produced by
                e-cigarettes contains harmful chemicals, such as formaldehyde and acrolein, which can irritate the
                respiratory system and lead to coughing, wheezing, and difficulty breathing.
                <br>

                E-cigarettes have also been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular problems, such as heart attack
                and stroke. The nicotine in e-cigarettes can constrict blood vessels and increase heart rate, which can
                increase the risk of these problems.
                <br>

                In addition to the risks mentioned above, e-cigarettes can also cause a number of other side effects,
                including:
                <br>

                •Dry mouth
                <br>
                •Headaches
                <br>
                •Nausea
                <br>
                •Vomiting
                <br>
                •Chest pain
                <br>
                •Allergic reactions
                <br>
                It's worth noting that the long-term health effects of e-cigarette use are not yet fully understood, as
                e-cigarettes are a relatively new product. However, the evidence suggests that they are not completely
                safe and can have negative side effects.

                If you're considering using e-cigarettes, it's important to be aware of the potential risks and to talk
                to your doctor about the best options for quitting smoking or reducing your nicotine intake. In general,
                it's best to avoid using e-cigarettes, especially if you're a non-smoker or have never smoked before.
