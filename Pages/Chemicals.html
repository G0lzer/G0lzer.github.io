            Cigarette smoke contains a complex mixture of over 7,000 chemicals, many of which are toxic and can cause
            cancer. Some of the most harmful chemicals found in cigarette smoke include:
            <br>

            •Tar: A sticky, brown substance that is produced when tobacco is burned. Tar can contain over 4,000 chemical
            compounds, including many known carcinogens such as benzene, formaldehyde, and arsenic.
            <br>

            •Carbon monoxide: A poisonous gas that is produced when tobacco is burned. Carbon monoxide can reduce the
            amount of oxygen that reaches the body's tissues, leading to numerous health problems.
            <br>

            •Formaldehyde: A chemical that is used in the production of many household products, including disinfectants
            and embalming fluids. Formaldehyde is classified as a human carcinogen by the International Agency for
            Research on Cancer.
            <br>

            •Ammonia: A chemical that is used in the production of many household products, including cleaning agents
            and
            fertilizers. Ammonia is a highly irritating gas that can cause respiratory problems.
            <br>

            •Hydrogen cyanide: A highly poisonous gas that is used in the production of pesticides and insecticides.
            Hydrogen cyanide can interfere with the body's ability to use oxygen, leading to serious health problems.
            <br>

            Overall, it is clear that cigarettes contain a much larger number of harmful chemicals than e-cigarette
            vapor. While e-cigarette vapor may contain some potentially harmful chemicals, the levels of these chemicals
            are generally much lower than those found in cigarette smoke. This is one of the main reasons why vaping is
            considered to be significantly healthier than smoking cigarettes.

            <p>
                In contrast, e-cigarette vapor typically contains a much smaller number of chemicals. The exact
                composition of e-cigarette vapor can vary depending on the specific e-cigarette and the liquid used, but
                it generally contains fewer harmful chemicals than cigarette smoke. Some of the chemicals that may be
                found in e-cigarette vapor include:
                <br>

                •Nicotine: A stimulant that is found in tobacco. Nicotine is addictive and can have negative effects on
                the body, particularly in large doses.
                <br>

                •Propylene glycol: A chemical that is commonly used in food products, cosmetics, and other household
                products. Propylene glycol is generally considered to be safe, although some studies have suggested that
                it may have negative effects on respiratory health when inhaled.
                <br>

                •Glycerol: A chemical that is commonly used in food products and personal care products. Glycerol is
                generally considered to be safe, although some studies have suggested that it may have negative effects
                on respiratory health when inhaled.
                <br>

                •Flavorings: Many e-cigarette liquids contain flavorings, which can be derived from a variety of sources,
                including natural and artificial flavors. Some flavorings, particularly those that are chemically
                synthesized, may be harmful when inhaled.
